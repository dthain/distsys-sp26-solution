# A2 Network Profiling

The student will make a connection between two processes on different machines and measure throughput using combinations of:

- TCP and UDP
- Packet Sizes

They should plot or record in some way the throughput for each transport layer protocol as the size of the data increases, and present them in a way so the differences can be observed.

They will make remarks about the observed differences.

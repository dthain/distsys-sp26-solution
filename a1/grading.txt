Measurement Technique (20 points)

Take a brief look at Test1.py to make sure the measurement technique
makes sense.  They should be using time.time_ns() or gettimeofday() or
something similar to make a subsecond measurement of a large number
of operations.  Award only 10 points if they are using whole-second
resolution, since that will result in serious rounding errors.

Results (50 points)

Award five points for each of these measurements.  The exact measurements
may vary depending on conditions, so count it as correct if they are in the
right order to magnitude, and the noted items are slower than their
faster counterparts.

Test1 - Function: 0.001 ms
Test2 - Create/Delete in Home: 5.000 ms
Test3 - Create/Delete in Temp: 0.500 ms (should be much faster than home)
Test4 - Get Time: 0.003 ms
Test5 -  Dict Insert: 0.002 ms
Test6 - TCP Connect: ~10ms (may be much longer)
Test7 - HTTP Fetch: ~25ms (should be much longer than plain TCP)
Test8 - JSON Parse: ~5ms
Test9 - Scandir: 1ms
Test10 - ls-l : 5ms (should be slower than plain scandir)

Observations (30 points)

+5 Fastest - Should be a trivial function call or possibly the dictionary insert. 
+5 Slowest - Should be the HTTP fetch because this involves multiple trips back and forth to the internet service in order to transfer data.
+5 Most Variable - Is most likely to be the HTTP fetch for the same reason.

Explaining the underlying reasons:

+5   The operations internal to the process (function call, dictionary insert) are naturally far faster (microseconds) than the operations external to the process.

+5   Open in /tmp is much faster than open the home directory.  This is because the home directory is on a filesystem shared across multiple machines, while /tmp is typically stored in memory on a single machine.

+5   Scanning the home directory via system calls is faster than invoking "ls -l" because the latter creates a new process and invokes an external program before accomplishing the same thing.

Measurement Technique (20 points)
------------------------------------------------
Measurement technique is correctly done and easy to read.

Results (50 points)
-------------------------
-5 Test8.py is opening the JSON file but not actually parsing it, so it's much faster than expected.
-5 Test9.py is slower than expected, because you included the detection of the home directory (os.path.expanduser) inside the measurement loop.

Commentary (30 points)
--------------------------------
Your overall description of the results is good, in particular pointing out
that the internal operations are faster than the external ones.

-5 One item you missed: "ls -l" should be slower than scandir() because it involves creating an external process.

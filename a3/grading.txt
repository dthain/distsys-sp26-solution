Grading Rubric for Assignment 3

Basic Operation (40 points)
---------------------------

Test the basic operation of the system works by having two windows open.

In the first window, ssh to `student10.cse.nd.edu` and run the server:

```
python HashTableServer.py 0
(port number should be printed out)
```

In the second window, ssh to `student11.cse.nd.edu` (note different machine) and run the client:

```
python TestBasics.py <host> <port>
```

This should result in the client performing basic operations
and emitting some output indicating that it connected and worked.

Deduct 5 points if the program does not implement the "use any port" feature,
and you have to specify a specific port to the server.

Server Code Details (20 points)
-------------------------------

+10 points - Take a brief look at HashTable.py - It should do very little except manipulate the hash table.
+10 points - Take a brief look at HashTableServer.py - Exceptions from HashTable.py should result in failure messages; exceptions from network operations should result in returning to the main loop.

Client Code Details (20 points)
-------------------------------

+ 10 points - Take a brief look at TestBasics.py to make sure that each kind of operation has been tested (insert, lookup, remove, size, query) for success, and also that two read operations (lookup, query) have been
tested for the failure case.  (It doesn't matter whether those operations return a KeyError or a null value, as long as they have some way of indicating failure.)

+ 5 points - Take a brief look at TestPerf.py to make sure the measurement technique makes sense.  They should be using time.time_ns() or gettimeofday() or something similar to make a subsecond measurement of a large number of successful operations.

+ 5 points - Take a brief look at HashTableClient.py to make sure they are sending a message with an "envelope": each message should be preceded by a message-length or terminated by a newline or other marker.  Each method should look like a proper function call, and not require the caller to make up the RPC messages by hand.

The additional file operations can be implemented in different ways for insert and lookup. The only imperative is that insert has two arguments, key and value, and lookup has one argument and returns the same type of value that was inserted. 

The value can be a python file object, class, struct or something provinding the same function. There can be any amount of supporting class methods to construct the value before it is given to insert, such as "value = HashTableValue(f); value.serialize(); insert('file.txt', value)"



Report (20 points)
------------------

+ 10 points - Examples: Must contain JSON or other format examples for a request, repsonse, and failure, for each of the insert, lookup, remove, size and query operations.

+ 5 points - Performance: Here is the observed performance on my solution, between student10 and student11:

insert:  xput 2141.547347282847 ops/s, latency 0.0004669520854949951s
lookup:  xput 5128.928041243669 ops/s, latency 0.00019497251510620117s
query:   xput 158.56314249521435 ops/s, latency 0.006306635856628418s
remove:  xput 5196.758765952174 ops/s, latency 0.0001924276351928711s

Throughput will likely vary quite a bit with different implementations and file sizes being transmitted. Insert and lookup
measurements may include disk I/O. I think any reasonable throughput is acceptable. 

Exceptionally slow results, or cases where there is a large discrepancy between insert and lookup should be scrutinized. 
Exceptionally fast results may have been run with two local processes which is not what the assignment specified.

Query, size, and remove should be quite uniform and a good deal faster than insert and lookup. 

+ 5 points Significance: A good discussion of the significance should observe that the time to insert/lookup/remove/query is 
much higher than the code of a trivial function call (or dictionary operation) b/c of the necessity of a network round trip.

Finally, create a file called `GRADE` alongside the student's code that
gives the overall grade breakdown, and specific comments and deductions
in each section.  Here is an example:

Assignment 2 - Remote Procedure Call

Basic Operation (40 points)
---------------------------
-5 Basic configuration works fine, however, the server doesn't choose a port automatically when zero is given.

Server Code Details (20 points)
-------------------------------
-5 Overall server structure is correct, however, you should catch exceptions when the client disconnects.

Client Code Details (20 points)
-------------------------------
TestBasics.py tests all of the essential operations correctly.

-5 TestPerf.py is doing the right work, but has a print statement in the inner loop, which throws off the performance.

Report (20 points)
------------------
-5 Nice examples of the JSON messages, and your general discussion is correct.  However, note that your performance is even slower than expected, due to the extra output message.  Please remove those for the next assignment.
